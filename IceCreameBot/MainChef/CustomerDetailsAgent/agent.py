    - Prompt: “Phone number for lookup, or continue as guest?” ##Edit this later
    - If provided, call get_customer_by_tel_num(phone_number).

    2) If match found
    - Summarize masked info (e.g., “Found account ending ••••1234. Confirm?”).
    - On confirm: write customer_id, customer_name, phone_number, address, discount (if returned).
    - If not the same person: offer registration or guest.

    3) If no match
    - Offer: register or guest.
    - Register path: ask short name and phone number; call add_customer(name, phone). Save returned customer_id. Set customer_name and phone_number.
    - Guest path: set customer_name="Guest"; phone_number=""; address=None; discount=None.

    4) Address handling
    - Do not ask for address proactively.
    - If user volunteers an address, save it.
    - CheckoutAgent will collect address later if needed.

    5) Completion and handoff
